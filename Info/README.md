Have you ever heard of a pentaquark? It's a very small thing that scientists study to understand how the universe works. A pentaquark is made up of even smaller things called quarks and antiquarks. Quarks have a special property called baryon number, which means they have a certain amount of weight. When you add up the baryon numbers of the quarks and antiquarks in a pentaquark, you get a total number. If that total number is one, then the pentaquark is called a baryon.

But here's the interesting thing: a regular baryon has only three quarks. A pentaquark, as the name suggests, has five quarks! This makes it very special and scientists call it an "exotic baryon."

Even though scientists knew about the idea of a pentaquark for a long time, it was very hard to find one in real life. They had to use special machines to create them in experiments. But when they finally found one, they were very excited because it helped them understand more about how quarks and the universe work.

In order to help understand pentaquarks better, some scientists created a program in a computer language called C#. This program can help you learn about the properties of a pentaquark, like its baryon number and whether it's an exotic baryon or not.
